# doubt-clarification
if we havenot done anything in first year and you are we are not having certifications what can we do ?
it's too young to get certifications and all these and they are not of any value the thing matters is knowledge and start learn
As a student i am not getting intrest get intrest to learn programming?
the reason why people don't like learning something is they don't know the value of that .feel it like a subject like maths ,physics ,chemistry and feel like if you don't perform well you will not get very good score.

Some things need to be inculcated to be in good position is
*learn to be consistent 
*learn how to use github
*try to document the things that you learn everyday
*more then doing lot of things being consistent in one thing is more imporatant
*be sincere towards your work and be commited.
